Files from making a layout from Stefan Schippers's bandgap
op amp in a video by Matt Venn,  Wednesday, March 29, 2023,
presented in a webinar on Thursday, April 15, 2023.

-----------------------------------------------------------

These files are being put up in a repository post-webinar
to share.  The files reflect the completed layout as
shown at the end of the webinar.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The setup for viewing the schematic requires copying the
"xschemrc" file from the PDK into the current working
directory (or providing it on the command line when starting
xschem).  Likewise, the ".magicrc" file can be copied from
the PDK into the current working directory or specified on
the command line (as shown in the webinar video).

-----------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains a convenience script that was not
used in the webinar, which automatically handles the
process of generating the netlist from the layout and
running netgen.  This script assumes the default PDK
location of /usr/local/share/pdk, but that can be overridden
by setting the environment variable PDK_ROOT.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Note that as in the webinar, the output netlist from xschem,
"zero_opamp.spice", has been manually edited to remove all
of the parasitic capacitances that appear in the schematic
drawing, as those should not be used for LVS.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Please use netgen version 1.5.252 or better, as the port
mismatch shown in the webinar is due to a bug when removing
the zero-volt voltage sources used in the schematic for
current measurement.
